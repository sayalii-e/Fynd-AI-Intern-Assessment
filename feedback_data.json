    "review": "I met a friend for lunch yesterday. \n\nLoved the water feature and patio walking in, if it had been warmer I would have definitely sat outside. \n\nInside was a little dark and I guess it was all the bats around but it reminded me of \"Dusk Till Dawn\". \n\nWe were seated, I hope was hoping for chips and salsa, I guess they don't serve them here? \nWe weren't even offered the ones on the menu, which I probably would have declined anyway because chips and salsa should be complimentary. \n\nAnyhow I ordered the Fresh Snapper Tacos (see pics) \nThere is a lot of fish there being smothered by all those peppers, but as for everything else what you see is what you get.\n\nFor $15 I would have liked more than a TBSP of each, rice and beans, and a DEFINITELY more than a teaspoon of cheese and sour cream and maybe a lime or lemon. \nThere was more garnish on the plate than anything. Other than that it was good. \n\nMy Friend ordered the Green Chile Stew and The Green Chile Mac and Cheese (see pics) She has been here before so knew what she liked. I tasted the macaroni and thought it was pretty good too.\n\nI'll give 3 stars until I go back and try out some other things.",
    "ai_response": "Dear valued customer, thank you for taking the time to share your honest feedback about your recent lunch visit. We appreciate your praise for our water feature and patio, and apologize that our indoor ambiance didn't quite meet your expectations, as well as the disappointment with the portion sizes of our Fresh Snapper Tacos. We're glad you enjoyed the taste of your meal and look forward to serving you again, hoping to exceed your expectations on your next visit.",
    "ai_summary": "Decent food, but portions were small for price.",
    "ai_actions": "* Consider adding complimentary chips and salsa to the menu, or at least offering them as a courtesy to customers, to enhance the dining experience.\n* Review the portion sizes of the Fresh Snapper Tacos and other dishes to ensure they provide sufficient value for the price, and consider adding more substantial sides or condiments.\n* Increase the lighting levels inside the restaurant to create a more welcoming atmosphere and reduce the \"dark\" ambiance that reminded the customer of a horror movie."

    "review": "This place is great.  A nice little ole' fashion homemade ice cream place that looks like it has been there for forever.  The place has a real nice vibe to it.  Sorta reminds me of Sugar Bowl only smaller, not as busy, and easier parking.\n\nThe menu is ginormous.  I couldn't decide what to get but that didn't matter because the other 3 people I went with chose for me.  I wanted something basic but they insisted on sharing the 'patte' thing.  It is a few scoops of ice cream over a brownie and topped with whip cream and caramel.  While it was very good it just wasn't what I wanted.  Next time I'm just going to get a scoop or 2 of the ice cream so I can really taste what the ice cream is all about.  It is just too difficult to tell when it is topped with a bunch of stuff.  The ice cream we got on the brownie though (butter brittle I think) was excellent.  They have tons of different flavors and they all sound delish!\n\nAnyway I can't wait to go back if I am ever in the area again and need a sugar rush!",
    "ai_response": "Thank you for sharing your wonderful review of our homemade ice cream shop - we're thrilled you enjoyed the nostalgic vibe and our extensive menu options. We appreciate your feedback on our 'patte' dessert, and we completely understand your desire to experience our ice cream in its pure form, so we look forward to serving you a simple scoop (or two!) on your next visit. We're glad you can't wait to come back and indulge in another sugar rush with us!",
    "ai_summary": "Great homemade ice cream place with huge menu options.",
    "ai_actions": "* Consider adding a \"flight\" or sampling option to the menu, allowing customers to try multiple flavors of ice cream without the added toppings, to help them determine their favorite flavors.\n* Train staff to proactively offer recommendations and ask customers about their preferences, to help those who are overwhelmed by the large menu make a decision that suits their taste.\n* Emphasize the quality and uniqueness of the ice cream itself in marketing and in-store promotions, to attract customers who are looking for a premium ice cream experience and want to taste the ice cream without a lot of added toppings."
